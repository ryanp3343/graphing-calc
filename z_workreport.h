    Features:
        -Not Implemented: all features are implented

        -Implemented: all features are implented

        -Partly implemented: all features are implented

    Bugs     : some expressions like a negative exponent and expression with a lot of paranthesis will crash

    Reflections: good culimation on everything learned this semester. from the starting classes to using pointers and
    making linked lists, to new concept of using a graphics library. The predator prey project helped alot with
    class inheritance for this project and creating shunting yard. While the hardest part was implementing code with
    sfml and how they interact
